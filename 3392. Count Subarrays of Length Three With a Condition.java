// Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays of length 3 such that the sum of the first and third numbers equals exactly half of the second number.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,2,1,4,1]

// Output: 1

// Explanation:

// Only the subarray [1,4,1] contains exactly 3 elements where the sum of the first and third numbers equals half the middle number.

// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [1,1,1]

// Output: 0

// Explanation:

// [1,1,1] is the only subarray of length 3. However, its first and third numbers do not add to half the middle number.

 

// Constraints:

// 3 <= nums.length <= 100
// -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

// Beats 100% with the easiest approach , and in O(n) time ðŸ’¯âœ…

// the basic approach is to maintain the window of three (As you are talking about subarray)

// In the Window we are basically checking what the question is demanding -- (first + third)*2 == second

// if it's coming out to be true , just increment the count by 1 , and in the return no of count

// by doing this we are solving it in O(1) space and O(n) time , we are achieving 100% beating percentage
// maybe there are better options but this one will be the easiest......
